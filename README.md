      <h2 align="left">About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a self-taught full-stack software developer who's passionate about expanding my knowledge and skills with the goal of finding a match with a team willing to give me a runway to grow into the key contributor I know I will be.</p>

<p>I have a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration, as well as several successful roles in the management of human services, customer service, and quick service businesses. These experiences inform my approach to problem-solving and getting things done. I am a strong believer in the power of collaboration and the value of open communication.
        </p>

<p>I've always been a curious person, a lifelong learner, and a maker at heart. Following my heart is why I decided to make a sea change in my professional life towards software development. I've been following <a href="https://theodinproject.com" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a> and it's been quite a journey of gaining knowledge and building the skills needed to succeed. I chose TOP because it was self-paced, open-source, and project-based, and from the get-go, I was gathering knowledge and building skills that I use every day as a developer. Thanks to The Odin Project's curriculum, I am extremely confident I can learn everything I need to know to be successful, no matter the stack.
      </p>

<p> When I need to step away from the computer, you'll often find me helping my amazing wife with home-improvement projects around our 200+ year old brick home, or out on the river kayaking with my family and friends. I can't wait to get back to my 3D printing and <a href="https://home-assistant.io" target="_blank"> home automation</a> obsessions which have had to be put on the back burner to make the space for this adventure. I do see a animal feeder with facial recognition in my future.</p>

      <h2 align="left">Currently Learning:</h2>
      <p>I am currently working on a full-stack blog project. On the backend, it is a Node.js project utilizing Express, a MongoDB Database, REST API, and Passport authentication middleware. On the front end, there is an authoring CMS suite, integrated with TinyMCE, with its own Passport Auth Strategy, as well as a separate blog frontend, both built in React and taking full advantage of React Router's data API features to create a performant and maintainable codebase.</p>
